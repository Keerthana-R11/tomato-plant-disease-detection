# Tomato-plant-disease-detection

This project focuses on automatic detection of tomato plant leaf diseases using image processing and machine learning / deep learning techniques.
The system analyzes leaf images to identify whether the plant is healthy or diseased, helping in early diagnosis and crop protection.

🎯 Objectives

* Detect tomato leaf diseases from images
* Improve accuracy using image preprocessing
* Classify diseases using ML / CNN models
* Reduce manual inspection and crop loss

🛠️ Technologies Used
 * Python
 * OpenCV
 * NumPy,Pandas
 * Scikit-learn
 * TensorFlow /Keras

🚀 Future Enhancements
* Real-time detection using mobile camera
* Deployment as a web or mobile app
* Multi-crop disease detection
* Improved performance under varying lighting conditions
